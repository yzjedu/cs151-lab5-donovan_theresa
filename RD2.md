Type the Reflection INSIDE the respective Word file and addressing the following questions:

 In Lab 5 we were supposed to accomplish designing and programming loops, re-using many of the other aspects of Python 
 we've learned so far,testing code, and error checking. We accomplished the objective by programming a loop to continue 
to reset unless the user inputs e. The program uses the most recent balance in each transaction to output the accurate
balance after the chosen procedure is calculated. We used a while loop to enter the passkey and then for the operations 
 of the atm system as well. To exit the atm system and while loop the user must enter 'e' and then they will be thanked and 
done with the program. A challenge I encountered and didn't overcome was writing the encryption for the passkey, so instead 
 I used a loop to provide the same idea of the encryption. A key takeaway I had from this lab is how to write a while loop and 
 escape one. Working with Donovan was successful we helped each other learn different concepts and communicated well with each other. 
I would rate this lab an 8/10 overall just because I wasn't able to successfully write the encryption.
